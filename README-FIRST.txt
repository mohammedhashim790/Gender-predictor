The following model was created using scikit-learn's advanced NLP Library . 

Prerequisite :
 
Python : version > 3.5

Instructions : 
[NOTE : IN ORDER TO EXPERIENCE BETTER PERFORMANCE RUN THE PROGRAM ON JUPYTER NOTEBOOK]

In order to execute the program, type "CMD" on the address bar of FILE EXPLORE(Example : This PC > D: > Files )or simply
or simopen command prompt and move to resprective directory where the program has been saved. 

type python Gender_prediction.py (shortcut : Type "python Gend" and click TAB)

click Enter to execute the code   



NOTE : The gender predictor model has an accuracy score of 89% , but never mind if your gender is wrongly predicted as it is a Basic model.
To the best of my knowledge it can predict your gender rightly as I've tested with few names.
